		<p>Insert This page holds links to Caleb Parsons' Intermediate Statistics in R case analyses. </p>

				<a href="/Rexburg_Housing_Analysis.html">Suggestions of Where to Live in Rexburg</a>
			<p>First analysis in R. Filtered through student housing options to meet the given criteria of an imaginary student using dplyr and the plotly package. The given four-dimensional scatterplot shows all possible housing options in Rexburg, ID showing apartment cost, distance from campus, number of resident per complex, and whether or not it fits the student's criteria. </p>

			<a href="/Movie_Genre_Analysis.html">Analysis of Effect of Number of Movie Genres on Rating</a>
			<p>Here I created an interactive boxplot and scatterplot using a data frame of 200 movies each year from the 1890's to 2005 using plotly. Within this analysis I investigated the relationship between the number of genres a movie has, its rating, and the movie budget.</p>

				<a href="/Utilities_Analysis.html">Comparison of Yearly Electricity and Gas Uses</a>
			<p>Use of a t-Test to show the difference between how much gas and electricity was used by one individual each year for several years. Used a simple ggplot histogram for visualization. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="portfolio-item">
			<a href="/RecallingWords.html">Effectiveness of Different Learning Methods</a>
			<p>I compared the effectiveness of two different learning methods against Standard Free Recall with two Wilcoxon Tests. As a result I had to split the level of significance between the two tests. I experimented with the ggpubr package to create a boxplot in this analysis.</p>
